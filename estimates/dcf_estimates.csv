# discount_rate_pct
#   - use 8% for the best (like JNJ), 15% for the worst (growth companies)
#   - think of this as expected annual return
#
# growth_rate1_pct
#   - used for the first 5 years; estimate using last 10-yr net income/revenue growth rate
# 
# growth_rate2_pct
#   - used for the last 5 years; estimate using last 10-yr net income/revenue growth rate
#
# perpetuity_growth_rate_pct
#   - growth rate after 10 years; 3% is usually OK, unless you think biz is excellent and raise to 4% or more
#
# mos_factor_pct
#   - how confident are you with your numbers above. Use 80% for the best; 40% for the worst.
#
# next_year_FCF (optional)
#   - fill this only for bad companies for which we can't just use past 10 years average FCF
